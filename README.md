## About

### Description and Purpose

#### Description
CodeFolio is a developer portfolio builder and social platform designed to help users showcase their projects while connecting with other developers. Users can create personalized profiles that highlight their tech stack, bio, location, and social links, along with uploading project details such as images and external links. The application supports CRUD functionality, allowing users to create posts, search for projects, comment on content, manage profiles, and has user authentication. CodeFolio provides an interactive space for developers to collaborate and grow together.

#### Purpose
The purpose of CodeFolio is to create a centralized platform where developers can easily showcase their work and discover others with similar interests. It aims to simplify networking by enabling meaningful connections within the developer community. By offering bite-sized project demos and an intuitive browsing experience, CodeFolio helps users learn from one another, gain inspiration, and open doors to internships, job opportunities, and collaborative projects.

### Inspiration

- We saw the need for a space where users can easily discover portfolios based on their interests and passions.
- We were inspired by the desire to collaborate with others, showcase our work, and create more opportunities for internships and jobs.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevDominique/codefolio.git
   cd CODEFOLIO
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```
     ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
- Server Directory
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```
   
   Add your keys for server dir:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=your_neon_url
   CLIENT_URL=your_deployed_website_url
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=github_client_secret
   ```

4. **Run development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Database Migrations

Use migrations for schema updates so existing data is preserved.

From the `server` directory:

1. Check migration status
   ```bash
   npm run migrate:status
   ```

2. Run pending migrations
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

3. Use reset only when you want to drop and recreate all tables
   ```bash
   npm run reset
   ```

Notes:
- `npm run migrate` applies each migration file once and records it in `schema_migrations`.
- `npm run reset` is destructive and should only be used for local clean rebuilds.
